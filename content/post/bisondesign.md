Welcome to the Bison Design blog!

I believe that crafting software is an art. My training in mathematics and
decades of experience developing enterprise software gave me a unique
perspective to appreciate software design. The search for simplicity influenced
my work and this is the subject of my blog.

I hope the excitement I feel upon finding that simplicity comes across in a way
that is both educational and entertaining. If you find these pages interesting
please share your insights in the comments.
