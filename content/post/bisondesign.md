Welcome to the Bison Design blog!

Crafting software is an art. My training in mathematics and decades of
experience </br>developing enterprise software gave me a unique perspective to
appreciate its beauty. The search for simplicity influenced my designs and
this is the subject of my blog.

I hope the excitement I feel upon finding that simplicity comes across in a way
that is both educational and entertaining. If you find these pages interesting
please share your insights in the comments.
